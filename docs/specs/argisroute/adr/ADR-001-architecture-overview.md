## Status

**Accepted** — Active since project inception

Last Updated: $(date +%Y-%m-%d)

---

## Context

The ${project} project emerged from a need to address complex technical challenges within the Phenotype ecosystem. During the initial planning phase, the development team identified several critical architectural decisions that would fundamentally shape the system's capabilities, maintainability, and scalability.

### Problem Statement

Modern software systems face an unprecedented combination of challenges:

- **Complexity Management**: Systems must handle increasingly complex business logic while remaining understandable and maintainable
- **Scalability Requirements**: Solutions must scale horizontally to meet growing demand without architectural redesign
- **Integration Demands**: Components must integrate seamlessly with existing infrastructure and third-party services
- **Performance Constraints**: Latency and throughput requirements continue to tighten as user expectations rise
- **Operational Concerns**: Systems must be observable, debuggable, and resilient in production environments

### Forces and Constraints

The following factors influenced our architectural decisions:

1. **Ecosystem Alignment**: As part of the Phenotype ecosystem, the solution must align with existing patterns, conventions, and infrastructure
2. **Language Ecosystem**: The primary implementation language's ecosystem provides specific affordances and constraints
3. **Team Expertise**: The development team's collective experience shapes feasible approaches
4. **Operational Environment**: Deployment targets (cloud-native, edge, embedded) impose specific requirements
5. **Regulatory Context**: Data handling, privacy, and compliance requirements affect architectural choices
6. **Performance Budget**: Explicit and implicit performance targets constrain design options
7. **Maintainability Horizon**: The expected system lifetime demands forward-compatible design

### Stakeholder Concerns

- **Developers**: Need clear abstractions, good tooling, and comprehensive documentation
- **Operators**: Require observability, clear failure modes, and automated recovery
- **Users**: Demand reliability, performance, and intuitive interfaces
- **Maintainers**: Seek minimal technical debt and clear extension points
- **Integrators**: Need stable APIs and comprehensive integration documentation

---

## Decision

We have decided to adopt a **layered modular architecture** with the following characteristics:

### Core Architectural Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Distinct system responsibilities are isolated into well-defined layers
2. **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations
3. **Single Responsibility**: Each module has one primary reason to change
4. **Open/Closed**: Modules are open for extension but closed for modification
5. **Explicit Interfaces**: All inter-module communication occurs through well-defined, versioned interfaces

### Architectural Layers

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    Presentation Layer                       │
│         (CLI, API endpoints, UI components)                 │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                    Application Layer                        │
│     (Use cases, workflows, orchestration logic)             │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                     Domain Layer                            │
│  (Business logic, domain models, invariants, rules)           │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                    Infrastructure Layer                     │
│   (Persistence, external APIs, platform services)           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Domain-Driven Design**: Core business logic is modeled explicitly using domain-driven design patterns, including aggregates, entities, value objects, and domain services
2. **Hexagonal Architecture**: The domain layer is protected by ports and adapters, allowing infrastructure concerns to be swapped without affecting business logic
3. **Event-Driven Communication**: Where appropriate, modules communicate via events to reduce coupling and enable reactive behaviors
4. **Configuration as Code**: All configuration is type-safe, version-controlled, and validated at startup

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

1. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns makes the system easier to understand and modify
2. **Testability**: Layer isolation enables comprehensive unit, integration, and acceptance testing
3. **Flexibility**: Infrastructure can be replaced without touching domain logic
4. **Scalability**: Independent scaling of layers based on their specific resource needs
5. **Team Autonomy**: Different teams can work on different layers with minimal coordination
6. **Evolution**: The architecture supports incremental refactoring and capability addition

### Negative Consequences

1. **Initial Complexity**: More abstractions and layers than a simple CRUD application
2. **Learning Curve**: New team members must understand the architectural patterns
3. **Ceremony**: Some simple operations may require navigating multiple layers
4. **Performance Overhead**: Abstraction layers introduce minor runtime overhead

### Mitigations

- Comprehensive documentation and examples for new team members
- Code generators for boilerplate reduction
- Performance budgets and continuous benchmarking
- Regular architecture decision reviews

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Simple Monolithic Architecture

**Approach**: Single-layer application with direct database and external service access

**Pros**: Simpler initial development, less boilerplate
**Cons**: Tight coupling, difficult testing, hard to evolve, scalability challenges
**Why Rejected**: Does not meet long-term maintainability and scalability requirements

### Alternative 2: Microservices Architecture

**Approach**: Decompose into independently deployable services

**Pros**: Independent scaling, technology diversity, team autonomy
**Cons**: Operational complexity, distributed system challenges, network overhead
**Why Rejected**: Excessive for current scope; could be adopted incrementally if needed

### Alternative 3: Serverless/Function-as-a-Service

**Approach**: Decompose into stateless functions deployed to serverless platform

**Pros**: Automatic scaling, pay-per-use, reduced operational burden
**Cons**: Cold start latency, vendor lock-in, limited execution duration
**Why Rejected**: Inconsistent with performance requirements and ecosystem alignment

## Additional Implementation Considerations

### Performance Characteristics

When implementing this architectural decision, the following performance characteristics must be considered:

- **Latency Requirements**: All operations should complete within defined SLAs. Critical paths must be optimized for sub-100ms response times.
- **Throughput Expectations**: The system should handle peak loads without degradation. Horizontal scaling capabilities must be verified under load.
- **Resource Utilization**: Memory, CPU, and I/O usage should remain within operational budgets. Resource leaks must be prevented through careful lifecycle management.

### Security Implications

Security must be considered at every layer of the implementation:

- **Data Protection**: Sensitive data must be encrypted at rest and in transit. Key rotation policies must be established.
- **Access Control**: Principle of least privilege must be enforced. Regular access reviews should be conducted.
- **Audit Requirements**: All significant operations must be logged for compliance and debugging purposes.

### Monitoring and Observability

Comprehensive observability is essential for operational success:

- **Metrics Collection**: Key performance indicators must be exposed through standardized metrics endpoints.
- **Distributed Tracing**: Request flows across components must be traceable for debugging complex issues.
- **Alerting Strategy**: Alerts should be actionable and routed to appropriate teams based on severity.

### Testing Strategy

Rigorous testing ensures the architecture functions as intended:

- **Unit Testing**: Individual components must have comprehensive unit tests covering edge cases.
- **Integration Testing**: Component interactions must be tested with realistic data and failure scenarios.
- **Load Testing**: System behavior under expected and peak loads must be validated.
- **Chaos Engineering**: Resilience should be verified through controlled failure injection.

### Documentation Requirements

Clear documentation ensures the architecture is maintainable:

- **Developer Documentation**: Implementation details must be documented for future maintainers.
- **Operational Runbooks**: Common procedures and troubleshooting guides must be readily available.
- **API Documentation**: All interfaces must be documented with examples and expected behaviors.

## Decision Validation Criteria

The success of this architectural decision will be measured against the following criteria:

| Criterion          | Target              | Measurement Method           |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Performance        | Meet defined SLAs   | Continuous benchmarking      |
| Reliability        | 99.9% availability  | Uptime monitoring            |
| Maintainability    | < 4 hours MTTR      | Incident analysis            |
| Developer Velocity | Onboard in < 2 days | Developer feedback           |
| Cost Efficiency    | Within budget       | Resource utilization metrics |

## Future Considerations

This decision should be revisited when:

- Scale increases by an order of magnitude
- New requirements emerge that challenge current assumptions
- Significant technology shifts occur in the ecosystem
- Operational issues reveal fundamental limitations
