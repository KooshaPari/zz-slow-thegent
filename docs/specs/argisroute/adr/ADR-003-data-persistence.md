# ADR-003: Data Persistence Strategy

## Status

**Accepted** — Active since project inception

Last Updated: $(date +%Y-%m-%d)

---

## Context

Data persistence is a critical concern for any non-trivial system. The chosen persistence strategy affects performance, scalability, consistency guarantees, operational complexity, and the ability to evolve the data model over time.

### Domain Requirements

The persistence layer must support:

1. **Entity Relationships**: Complex domain models with references between entities
2. **Transaction Boundaries**: ACID transactions for consistency-critical operations
3. **Query Patterns**: Efficient support for anticipated read patterns
4. **Data Volume**: Storage and retrieval of large datasets
5. **Access Patterns**: Mix of OLTP (transactional) and analytical queries
6. **Retention**: Configurable data retention and archival policies

### Operational Requirements

1. **Availability**: 99.9% uptime for data access
2. **Durability**: Zero unplanned data loss
3. **Latency**: Sub-10ms read latency for hot data
4. **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling as data volume grows
5. **Backup/Recovery**: Point-in-time recovery capability
6. **Monitoring**: Comprehensive observability of storage health

## Decision

We have decided to adopt a **polyglot persistence** strategy with the following components:

### Primary Data Store

**Relational Database** for primary persistence:

- ACID transactions for consistency
- Rich query capabilities
- Mature operational tooling
- Strong data integrity constraints

**Rationale**: The domain model benefits from relational structure, transactions, and referential integrity. Most operations require consistent, validated updates to multiple related entities.

### Caching Layer

**In-Memory Cache** for hot data:

- Sub-millisecond read access
- Reduced load on primary store
- Configurable TTL and eviction policies

**Use Cases**: Frequently accessed reference data, session state, computed aggregations

### Event Store (Optional)

**Append-Only Event Log** for critical events:

- Immutable audit trail
- Event sourcing capability
- Replay and reconstruction support

**Use Cases**: Audit logging, event sourcing for specific aggregates, stream processing input

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

1. **Consistency**: ACID transactions ensure data integrity
2. **Performance**: Caching reduces latency for hot data
3. **Scalability**: Read replicas and caching enable horizontal read scaling
4. **Flexibility**: Different storage types for different access patterns
5. **Auditability**: Event store provides complete audit trail
6. **Reliability**: Proven, mature technologies with extensive operational tooling

### Negative Consequences

1. **Complexity**: Multiple storage systems to operate
2. **Consistency Challenges**: Cache invalidation and eventual consistency in replicas
3. **Operational Overhead**: More systems to monitor, backup, and maintain
4. **Learning Curve**: Team must understand multiple storage technologies

### Mitigations

- Comprehensive operational runbooks
- Automated cache invalidation strategies
- Strong observability across all storage layers
- Regular disaster recovery drills
- Team training on operational procedures

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Single Document Store

**Approach**: Use a document database (e.g., MongoDB) for all persistence

**Pros**: Simple operational model, flexible schema, good horizontal scaling
**Cons**: Limited transaction support, eventual consistency by default, weaker relational capabilities
**Why Rejected**: Domain requires strong consistency and relational integrity that document stores don't natively provide

### Alternative 2: Pure Event Sourcing

**Approach**: Store only events, reconstruct state through replay

**Pros**: Complete audit trail, temporal queries, easy to add new read models
**Cons**: Complex implementation, versioning challenges, snapshot management
**Why Rejected**: Overkill for current requirements; adds unnecessary complexity

### Alternative 3: Key-Value Store Only

**Approach**: Use a simple key-value store (e.g., Redis, DynamoDB) for all data

**Pros**: Extreme performance, simple operations, excellent horizontal scaling
**Cons**: Limited query capabilities, no transactions, schema enforced by application
**Why Rejected**: Doesn't meet query complexity and transactional requirements

### Alternative 4: Graph Database

**Approach**: Use a graph database for all relational data

**Pros**: Excellent for relationship-heavy queries, flexible schema
**Cons**: Specialized expertise required, less mature ecosystem, operational complexity
**Why Rejected**: Graph-specific queries not a significant requirement; relational DB handles relationships adequately

---

## Schema Design Principles

1. **Normalized Core Schema**: Primary entities in normalized form for integrity
2. **Materialized Views**: Read-optimized views for complex queries
3. **Explicit Migration Strategy**: Version-controlled schema migrations
4. **Domain-Driven Types**: Database types align with domain value objects

## Data Lifecycle Management

1. **Hot Data**: In cache and primary DB, frequent access
2. **Warm Data**: In primary DB, occasional access
3. **Cold Data**: Archived to cold storage after retention period
4. **Deleted Data**: Soft deletes with audit trail, eventual hard delete per policy

## Additional Implementation Considerations

### Performance Characteristics

When implementing this architectural decision, the following performance characteristics must be considered:

- **Latency Requirements**: All operations should complete within defined SLAs. Critical paths must be optimized for sub-100ms response times.
- **Throughput Expectations**: The system should handle peak loads without degradation. Horizontal scaling capabilities must be verified under load.
- **Resource Utilization**: Memory, CPU, and I/O usage should remain within operational budgets. Resource leaks must be prevented through careful lifecycle management.

### Security Implications

Security must be considered at every layer of the implementation:

- **Data Protection**: Sensitive data must be encrypted at rest and in transit. Key rotation policies must be established.
- **Access Control**: Principle of least privilege must be enforced. Regular access reviews should be conducted.
- **Audit Requirements**: All significant operations must be logged for compliance and debugging purposes.

### Monitoring and Observability

Comprehensive observability is essential for operational success:

- **Metrics Collection**: Key performance indicators must be exposed through standardized metrics endpoints.
- **Distributed Tracing**: Request flows across components must be traceable for debugging complex issues.
- **Alerting Strategy**: Alerts should be actionable and routed to appropriate teams based on severity.

### Testing Strategy

Rigorous testing ensures the architecture functions as intended:

- **Unit Testing**: Individual components must have comprehensive unit tests covering edge cases.
- **Integration Testing**: Component interactions must be tested with realistic data and failure scenarios.
- **Load Testing**: System behavior under expected and peak loads must be validated.
- **Chaos Engineering**: Resilience should be verified through controlled failure injection.

### Documentation Requirements

Clear documentation ensures the architecture is maintainable:

- **Developer Documentation**: Implementation details must be documented for future maintainers.
- **Operational Runbooks**: Common procedures and troubleshooting guides must be readily available.
- **API Documentation**: All interfaces must be documented with examples and expected behaviors.

## Decision Validation Criteria

The success of this architectural decision will be measured against the following criteria:

| Criterion          | Target              | Measurement Method           |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Performance        | Meet defined SLAs   | Continuous benchmarking      |
| Reliability        | 99.9% availability  | Uptime monitoring            |
| Maintainability    | < 4 hours MTTR      | Incident analysis            |
| Developer Velocity | Onboard in < 2 days | Developer feedback           |
| Cost Efficiency    | Within budget       | Resource utilization metrics |

## Future Considerations

This decision should be revisited when:

- Scale increases by an order of magnitude
- New requirements emerge that challenge current assumptions
- Significant technology shifts occur in the ecosystem
- Operational issues reveal fundamental limitations
