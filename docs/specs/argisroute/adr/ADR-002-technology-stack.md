## Context

Selecting an appropriate technology stack is one of the most consequential architectural decisions. The chosen technologies will affect development velocity, runtime performance, operational characteristics, hiring, and long-term system maintainability.

### Requirements Analysis

Before evaluating technologies, we established clear requirements across multiple dimensions:

#### Functional Requirements

- Support for core domain operations (detailed in SPEC.md)
- Integration capabilities with existing Phenotype ecosystem components
- Extensibility for future feature additions
- Compliance with relevant standards and protocols

#### Non-Functional Requirements

| Category        | Requirement                             | Priority |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Performance     | Response time < 100ms p99               | High     |
| Throughput      | Handle 10,000+ concurrent operations    | High     |
| Availability    | 99.9% uptime SLA                        | Critical |
| Scalability     | Horizontal scaling without code changes | High     |

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

1. **Developer Productivity**: Familiar, well-documented technologies enable rapid development
2. **Runtime Performance**: Selected technologies meet performance requirements
3. **Operational Excellence**: Strong observability and tooling support operations
4. **Ecosystem Leverage**: Integration with existing Phenotype components is straightforward
5. **Talent Acquisition**: Mainstream technologies facilitate hiring
6. **Long-term Support**: Active communities and commercial backing ensure longevity

### Negative Consequences

1. **Learning Requirements**: Some team members may need training on specific technologies
2. **Upgrade Burden**: Regular updates required to stay current
3. **Vendor Dependencies**: Some components tied to specific vendors/platforms

### Risk Mitigation

- Comprehensive documentation and runbooks
- Gradual adoption with feature flags
- Vendor abstraction layers where appropriate
- Regular technology review and upgrade cycles

---

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative Stack A: Cutting-Edge Technologies

**Approach**: Adopt latest experimental technologies for maximum performance

**Pros**: Potential for superior performance, early adopter advantages
**Cons**: Immature tooling, limited documentation, hiring challenges, upgrade risk
**Why Rejected**: Unacceptable risk for production system; doesn't meet stability requirements

### Alternative Stack B: Minimalist Approach

**Approach**: Use only standard library features, minimal external dependencies

**Pros**: Maximum control, minimal dependency risk, deep understanding
**Cons**: Slower development, reinventing solutions, maintenance burden
**Why Rejected**: Would significantly delay delivery and increase ongoing maintenance costs

### Alternative Stack C: Legacy Technology

**Approach**: Use mature but aging technologies with extensive proven usage

**Pros**: Well-understood, extensive documentation, large talent pool
**Cons**: Falling behind modern practices, limited innovation, eventual migration cost
**Why Rejected**: Would create technical debt and limit future evolution

## Additional Implementation Considerations

### Performance Characteristics

When implementing this architectural decision, the following performance characteristics must be considered:

- **Latency Requirements**: All operations should complete within defined SLAs. Critical paths must be optimized for sub-100ms response times.
- **Throughput Expectations**: The system should handle peak loads without degradation. Horizontal scaling capabilities must be verified under load.
- **Resource Utilization**: Memory, CPU, and I/O usage should remain within operational budgets. Resource leaks must be prevented through careful lifecycle management.

### Security Implications

Security must be considered at every layer of the implementation:

- **Data Protection**: Sensitive data must be encrypted at rest and in transit. Key rotation policies must be established.
- **Access Control**: Principle of least privilege must be enforced. Regular access reviews should be conducted.
- **Audit Requirements**: All significant operations must be logged for compliance and debugging purposes.

### Monitoring and Observability

Comprehensive observability is essential for operational success:

- **Metrics Collection**: Key performance indicators must be exposed through standardized metrics endpoints.
- **Distributed Tracing**: Request flows across components must be traceable for debugging complex issues.
- **Alerting Strategy**: Alerts should be actionable and routed to appropriate teams based on severity.

### Testing Strategy

Rigorous testing ensures the architecture functions as intended:

- **Unit Testing**: Individual components must have comprehensive unit tests covering edge cases.
- **Integration Testing**: Component interactions must be tested with realistic data and failure scenarios.
- **Load Testing**: System behavior under expected and peak loads must be validated.
- **Chaos Engineering**: Resilience should be verified through controlled failure injection.

### Documentation Requirements

Clear documentation ensures the architecture is maintainable:

- **Developer Documentation**: Implementation details must be documented for future maintainers.
- **Operational Runbooks**: Common procedures and troubleshooting guides must be readily available.
- **API Documentation**: All interfaces must be documented with examples and expected behaviors.

## Decision Validation Criteria

The success of this architectural decision will be measured against the following criteria:

| Criterion          | Target              | Measurement Method           |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Performance        | Meet defined SLAs   | Continuous benchmarking      |
| Reliability        | 99.9% availability  | Uptime monitoring            |
| Maintainability    | < 4 hours MTTR      | Incident analysis            |
| Developer Velocity | Onboard in < 2 days | Developer feedback           |
| Cost Efficiency    | Within budget       | Resource utilization metrics |

## Future Considerations

This decision should be revisited when:

- Scale increases by an order of magnitude
- New requirements emerge that challenge current assumptions
- Significant technology shifts occur in the ecosystem
- Operational issues reveal fundamental limitations
