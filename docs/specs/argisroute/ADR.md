## Introduction

### What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. The goal is to provide a historical record of why decisions were made, making it easier for current and future team members to understand the rationale behind the architecture.

### Why ADRs Matter

1. **Knowledge Preservation**: Decisions made today are often forgotten tomorrow. ADRs preserve institutional knowledge.
2. **Onboarding**: New team members can understand why the system is built the way it is.
3. **Decision Reversibility**: When assumptions change, ADRs make it clear what needs to be revisited.
4. **Consensus Building**: Writing down decisions forces clarity and alignment.
5. **Context for Future Changes**: Understanding the "why" helps prevent breaking important invariants.

### ADR Lifecycle

| Status         | Description                                           |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Proposed**   | Decision is under discussion, seeking feedback        |
| **Accepted**   | Decision has been agreed upon and is in effect        |
| **Deprecated** | Decision is no longer relevant or has been superseded |
| **Superseded** | A newer ADR replaces this one (link to replacement)   |

## Sample ADRs

### ADR-001: Technology Stack Selection

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2026-01-15
**Owner**: Team Lead

#### Context

The project requires a technology stack that balances developer productivity, performance, and maintainability. We evaluated multiple options for frontend, backend, and database layers.

#### Decision

Selected stack:

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Rust (Axum/Tokio) for performance-critical paths, Node.js for rapid prototyping
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for relational data, Redis for caching
- **Infrastructure**: Docker containers on Kubernetes

#### Consequences

**Positive**:

- Rust provides excellent performance and type safety
- TypeScript enables full-stack type sharing
- PostgreSQL offers ACID compliance and rich querying

**Negative**:

- Rust has a steeper learning curve for new team members
- More complex build pipeline required

#### Alternatives Considered

- Go: Good performance but less expressive type system
- Python: Faster development but runtime performance concerns
- MongoDB: Flexible schema but eventual consistency challenges

---

### ADR-002: Database Architecture

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2026-01-20
**Owner**: Architect

#### Context

Data storage requirements include relational data, time-series metrics, and document-like flexible schemas. Need to balance consistency, availability, and partition tolerance.

#### Decision

Polyglot persistence approach:

- **Primary Store**: PostgreSQL for transactional data
- **Cache Layer**: Redis for session and query caching
- **Search**: Elasticsearch for full-text search (future consideration)
- **Analytics**: Columnar storage for OLAP (future consideration)

#### Consequences

**Positive**:

- Each data type uses optimal storage
- Clear separation of concerns
- Can scale components independently

**Negative**:

- Operational complexity increases
- Need expertise in multiple systems

---

### ADR-003: API Design Principles

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2026-02-01
**Owner**: API Team

#### Context

APIs are the contract between services and clients. Consistent, well-designed APIs improve developer experience and reduce integration friction.

#### Decision

Adopt RESTful principles with the following specifics:

- JSON for request/response bodies
- Standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH)
- Resource-oriented URLs (/users/{id}, not /getUser)
- Versioning via URL path (/v1/users)
- RFC 7807 Problem Details for errors

#### Consequences

**Positive**:

- Predictable API behavior
- Easy to document with OpenAPI
- Broad client support

**Negative**:

- REST may not fit all use cases (e.g., real-time)
- Versioning adds maintenance overhead

---

### ADR-004: Authentication and Authorization

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2026-02-10
**Owner**: Security Team

#### Context

Security is paramount. The system must authenticate users and services, authorize actions, and maintain audit trails.

#### Decision

- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 with JWT access tokens
- **Authorization**: RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) with resource-level permissions
- **Token Storage**: HttpOnly cookies for web, Authorization header for APIs
- **Refresh**: Short-lived access tokens (15 min), longer refresh tokens (7 days)

#### Consequences

**Positive**:

- Industry-standard security practices
- Stateless authentication enables horizontal scaling
- Fine-grained permission control

**Negative**:

- Token revocation requires additional infrastructure
- JWT size can impact request headers

---

### ADR-005: Deployment Strategy

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2026-02-15
**Owner**: DevOps

#### Context

Deployment must be reliable, reversible, and support zero-downtime updates. The system serves production traffic 24/7.

#### Decision

- **Platform**: Kubernetes with GitOps (ArgoCD)
- **Strategy**: Blue-green deployments for critical services
- **Rollback**: Automatic rollback on health check failure
- **Environments**: dev, staging, prod with identical configurations

#### Consequences

**Positive**:

- Zero-downtime deployments
- Easy rollback capability
- Infrastructure as Code

**Negative**:

- Kubernetes complexity requires expertise
- Resource overhead for small deployments

---

### ADR-006: Caching Strategy

**Status**: Proposed
**Date**: 2026-03-01
**Owner**: Performance Team

#### Context

Database load and response latency can be reduced with strategic caching. However, stale data and cache invalidation are significant concerns.

#### Decision

- **Layer 1**: In-memory LRU cache per instance (hot data)
- **Layer 2**: Redis distributed cache (shared across instances)
- **Strategy**: Cache-aside (lazy loading) with TTL
- **Invalidation**: Event-driven invalidation on data mutation

#### Consequences

**Positive**:

- Reduced database load
- Faster response times
- Graceful degradation if cache fails

**Negative**:

- Cache consistency challenges
- Additional infrastructure to manage

---

### ADR-007: Event Sourcing vs CRUD

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2026-03-10
**Owner**: Architecture

#### Context

Audit requirements and need for temporal queries suggest event sourcing, but CRUD is simpler and well-understood.

#### Decision

Hybrid approach:

- **Core entities**: Event sourcing for audit-critical data
- **Supporting data**: CRUD for simple lookup tables
- **Projection**: Read models derived from event streams
- **Storage**: Event store for events, relational for projections

#### Consequences

**Positive**:

- Complete audit trail
- Temporal queries possible
- Can rebuild state from events

**Negative**:

- Higher complexity
- Eventual consistency in projections
- Learning curve for team

---

### ADR-008: Microservices vs Monolith

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2026-03-15
**Owner**: CTO

#### Context

Team is growing, different components have different scaling requirements. Need to balance deployment independence with operational complexity.

#### Decision

- **Start**: Modular monolith with clear bounded contexts
- **Evolve**: Extract services when a module has independent scaling/deployment needs
- **Communication**: Async messaging between services (Kafka/RabbitMQ)
- **Data**: Database per service when extracted

#### Consequences

**Positive**:

- Faster development initially
- Clear boundaries enable future extraction
- Reduced operational overhead early on

**Negative**:

- Risk of tight coupling if boundaries not respected
- Later extraction requires effort

---

### ADR-009: Testing Strategy

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2026-03-20
**Owner**: QA Lead

#### Context

Quality is non-negotiable. Testing must be comprehensive yet efficient, providing confidence without slowing development.

#### Decision

Testing pyramid:

- **Unit tests**: 70% coverage, fast, no I/O
- **Integration tests**: 20%, test component interactions
- **E2E tests**: 10%, critical user journeys only
- **Tools**: Built-in test frameworks + property testing
- **CI**: All tests run on every PR, coverage gates

#### Consequences

**Positive**:

- Fast feedback on most changes
- High confidence in refactorings
- Bugs caught early

**Negative**:

- Test maintenance requires discipline
- E2E tests can be flaky

---

### ADR-010: Observability and Monitoring

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2026-03-25
**Owner**: SRE Team

#### Context

Production systems fail. When they do, we need to understand why quickly. Observability is about asking questions of the system without prior instrumentation.

#### Decision

Three pillars of observability:

- **Metrics**: Prometheus for aggregation, Grafana for visualization
- **Logs**: Structured JSON logging, centralized aggregation
- **Traces**: Distributed tracing for request flows
- **Alerting**: PagerDuty integration, alert on symptoms not causes

#### Consequences

**Positive**:

- Faster incident resolution
- Data-driven capacity planning
- Proactive issue detection

**Negative**:

- Storage costs for telemetry
- Performance overhead of instrumentation
