"""Single-Writer Lock Discipline (WL-175): Enforce serial access to shared resources.

Provides a file-based lock mechanism to ensure that only one agent or process
can write to critical resources at a time (e.g., WORK_STREAM.md, config files,
autosync state).

The lock is implemented using a lockfile at docs/reference/autosync.lock,
which contains the owner ID and timestamp. The lock can be acquired, released,
checked, and forcefully released in emergencies.

This is a lightweight alternative to distributed locks (etcd, Zookeeper) and
is suitable for single-machine, single-repository environments.
